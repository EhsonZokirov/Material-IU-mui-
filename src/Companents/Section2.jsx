        Tucked away in the corner of Wellington, Latte Cafe is a local
        neighbourhood cafe and bar. Latte is all about doing what we love, in a
        city that we love. We keep stocked with local produce and pastries.
        Bring your family for a bite, or meet your friends for a coffee or warm
        drink.
